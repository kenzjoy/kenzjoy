### Hi there, my name is Kenz. Welcome to my perfectly imperfect github. I am actively applying to my first software engineering position coming out of a coding bootcamp at Turing School of Software & Design. I am more determined than ever to continue to learn the ever-changing ways of what it means to be a developer. Lets connect!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: landing my first dev job! I am open to learning new languages and frameworks. I just love making applications come to life.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: everything, all the time.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: anything to help sharpen my skills and processes. I want to be a more efficient programmer!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: how many steps I walk in a day on my desk-treadmill.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: gmail: kenz.joy.tech@gmail.com | LinkedIn: [kenzjoydev](www.linkedin.com/in/kenzjoydev)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am currently training for a 50 mile mountain bike race scheduled for July 2023 in Telluride, CO!
